# FinancialTracker
This is my first JavaFX app for managing transactions. It allows users to track, add, update, and search transactions, connected to a MySQL database. The app offers filtering, transaction breakdowns, and basic statistics. This project showcases my skills in JavaFX, MySQL, and CRUD operations.
